Yeet Yote this is my first experience in python so please be nice

This should help your RPG with stats and encounter system based off a manga I read a bit ago which got me hooked on this idea.  Some things may be unbalanced so please be warned

You will have to download python and kivy onto your computer if you want to run this, but don't worry, if you are running this, that means you probably have a reason to and someone is forcing you to do it to make their campaign run smoother, this may also be me, so please complain for future Chandler and say that the instructions aren't clear!
